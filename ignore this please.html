        <h2> SUMMARY </h2>
        <br>
        <p> The CCFTA is Canada’s public art funder; providing resources and assistance to Canadian artists in order to enrich the vibrant art scene in Canada. While they show clear intent in their copy, their navigation and (lack of) visual direction gave users trouble in their experience of the site. I focused on ensuring that users could easily find the resources they needed, while maintaining an aesthetic based in the cultural arts.</p>
        <h2> THE RE-DESIGN PROCESS </h2>

        <p> These user tests highlighted four key issues with the current site.
            There are not enough clickable links within the main bodies of text.
            The portal exists on a different site and users are unable to return to the CCFTA site natively.
            The website’s design does not capture the user’s attention and this manifests in users ignoring what is on the screen.
            Users had to use trial and error to get to the portal, and multiple users needed assistance in completing the task.</p>
